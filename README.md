# Scans of Acorn Risc PC PCBs

This repository contains front and back side scans of various [Acorn Risc PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risc_PC) system PCBs.

It presently includes:

* Mark 1, 2 and 3 motherboards
* ARM610 and ARM710 CPU cards
* 1M VRAM
* 4-slot backplane

They're huge PNGs for reasons of quality, but have been squashed as much as possible with zopflipng.
